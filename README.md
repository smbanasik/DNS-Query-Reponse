# DNS-Query-Reponse
A DNS query and response parser that I made for a class. It sends a DNS query to a specified server and parses the binary data for the answers and then displays it.
It has error handling for malformed packets.

## Usage
To use, provide either a domain name or an IP address for lookup and the DNS server you wish to contact.
